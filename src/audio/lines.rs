//! Bevy-free voice-line catalog + pure resolver. Every spoken line in the game is one [`Line`]
//! entry here: its speaker, transcript (the on-screen subtitle AND our in-code record of the
//! quote, per CLAUDE.md), whether it can be cut off, its barge-in priority, and optional reply
//! chains. The Bevy glue that actually plays clips lives in `director.rs`; this module is pure
//! data + decision logic so it can be unit-tested without spinning up an App.
//!
//! Model is the Valve "dynamic dialog" bark scheme (see
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-09-voice-line-catalog-refactor.md`): a concept fires, the
//! resolver gathers candidate lines for it, filters by a per-line replay floor, and picks one.
